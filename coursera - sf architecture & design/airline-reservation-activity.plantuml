' Create a UML sequence diagram that will show your clients how the systemâ€™s classes will interact when customers are buying their flight tickets on the booking website.

' The system should allow the customer to search available flights from the database by inputting their desired location and departure/arrival date.
' The website will search the database and return the available flights to display.
' Once the customer has chosen the flight, they will add the flight to their cart and checkout.
' They will also then input their payment information and once everything is complete, the website should confirm the flight, empty cart and lastly display a confirmation of the ticket for the flight.
