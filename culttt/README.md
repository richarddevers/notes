The boundary that surround a particular model.

- Terminology clear inside it (no polysem)
- loose coupling. Easy to test. You don't care of the outside world.

# DDD Modules

<https://www.culttt.com/2014/12/10/modules-domain-driven-design/>

Container for a specific set of class.

- derived from the ubiquitous language
- contains one or more aggregates (cohesive)
- organised by the domain
- loosely couple
