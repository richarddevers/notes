- "DDD is about designing software based on models of the underlying domain"
- Domain model act as ubiquitous language.
- Must avoid polyseme (a word with different meaning besed on the context)
- polyseme emerge from bounded context
- to avoir them , create one Data Model per context

Domain Model: Business Model ("m√©tiers")
    - data
    - behavior

Ubiquitous Language: common language between the developers and users
    - based on the domain model used in the software
    - rigorous
    - explicit
