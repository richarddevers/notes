# Async Python: The Different Forms of Concurrency

source: <http://masnun.rocks/2016/10/06/async-python-the-different-forms-of-concurrency/>

## Sync

task executed one after another. You have to wait the end of the previous task before starting the next one. Blocking

## Async

task can be paused. when a task paused, another one can start. Non blocking

## Concurrency

Managing the context switching between differents tasks. But only one task is executed at a time. However, this can give the illusion of parallelism.

## Parallelism

Multiple tasks are run **at the same time**

## Recap

- Sync: Blocking operations.
- Async: Non blocking operations.
- Concurrency: Making progress together.
- Parallelism: Making progress in parallel.

**Parallelism implies Concurrency. But Concurrency doesnâ€™t always mean Parallelism**

## Threads

Python threads allow concurrency.

But GIL allow only one threads at a time, so no parallelism.

## Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)

What?

- ensure the python interpreter run one thred at a time

Why?

- easier memory management
- better integrations with C
- GIL makes it easy to integrate non thread safe C libraries (???)

How?

- the python interpreter switch between threads to allow concurrency

Facts

- The most common python implementation is CPython (which has GIL). However, not every implementations have GIL. Jython for eg doesn't have GIL.
- single threaded programs are fast thanks to the GIL
- for I/O bound operations, GIL usually doesn't harm much (i guess depending on the quantity?)
- for CPU bound task, the interpreter siwtch between n ticks and switch.

# Process

To get parallelism -> multiprocessing

allow python to spawn multiple process that can run in //
