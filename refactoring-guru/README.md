“When you want to make two class­es col­lab­o­rate:

- Deter­mine what exact­ly one object needs from the other: which meth­ods does it exe­cute?
- Describe these meth­ods in a new inter­face or abstract class.
- Make the class that is a depen­den­cy imple­ment this interface.
- Now make the sec­ond class depen­dent on this inter­face rather than on the con­crete class. You still can make it work with - objects of the orig­i­nal class, but the con­nec­tion is now much more flexible.”
